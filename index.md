## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Semiconductor System Lab (SSL)](http://ssl.kaist.ac.kr) advised by [Prof. Hoi-Jun Yoo](http://ssl.kaist.ac.kr/Professor.php) at [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr).
I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of EE at KAIST in 2020 and 2022, respectively. 
My current research interests include energy-efficient System-on-Chip design, especially focused on AI-powered AR/VR and 3D vision systems. Over the past 4 years, I have participated in the design of 3 silicon chips related to artificial intelligence.


## Research Interests

- **Neural Graphics Acceleration for AR/VR:** ISSCC'23, ASSCC'23, ISSCC'24
- **3D Vision System:** ISSCC'22
- **AR/VR System-on-Chip:** IEDM'21
- **DNN Accelerator:** JSSC'21, HPCA'23
